I signed up to theGrid some time around a decade ago, I think. When they first came up with it, anyway, although clearly I was beaten by quite a lot of other Beta testers. 

Here I am, and now I have no idea what to do next. Maybe I'll use this as the place I actually rant about the things I can't rant about over at https://www.fifty6.co.uk or http://jasondilworth.co.uk

Here's an image.
